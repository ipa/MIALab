Generally like presentation...

Abstract: 

Introduction (Severin): 
planning, chosing of femoral component in knee implant, therefore segmentation of femur in mri image of the knee
mri because of less radiation
state of the art
goal: dice 0.95 std 0.05 <5 min computation time
robustness more important then accuracy

Methods (Iwan): 
fully automatic
show the pipeline
preprocessing (normlization, wiener filer), maybe show picture
training, features, relative position, show kernels, number of trees, 2d features
postprocessing, opening, largest area, filling, largest volume, show images as in presentation
explain our cross validation procedure (DICE not OOB score)

Results (Iwan): 
show boxplot
best and worst case

Discussion (Iwan): 
why did the worst case happen?
discuss the results (boxplots and score), is it robust enough?
speed

Conclusion (Severin):
can it be used to solve the clinical problem?
goal reached?

Outlook:
include prior information
3d features
more bone structures
