\section{Materials \& Methods}
Wee seek for an automatic method to segment the distal femur on MR images of the knee. Therefore we use a Random Forest classifier, for which we have 20 MR images to train and test. The whole algorithm is shown in ... \\
In order to compensate for different grey-scale ranges, the images are first normalized using Z-Score normalisation \autoref{eq:zscorenormalize}. In a second step a Wiener filter is applied to reduce the noise. 
\begin{equation}
I_n = \frac{I - \mu}{\sigma}
\label{eq:zscorenormalize}
\end{equation}
\subsection{Feature Extraction}



%fully automatic
%show the pipeline
%preprocessing (normlization, wiener filer), maybe show picture
%training, features, relative position, show kernels, number of trees, 2d features
%postprocessing, opening, largest area, filling, largest volume, show images as in presentation
%explain our cross validation procedure (DICE not OOB score)
