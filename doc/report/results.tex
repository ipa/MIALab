\section{Results}
The average computation time for the whole proposed algorithm is $2.5$ minutes for one MRI volume. A 5-fold cross validation yields a mean DICE of $0.91$ with a standard deviation of $0.03$. The range lies between $0.85$ and $0.96$ and has a median of $0.9$. In \autoref{fig:dicecrossvalid} the DICE after RF is compared to the DICE after the post processing. One can see, that the post processing increases the results by $0.05$ on average.

In \autoref{fig:opjectiveResults} the optically best and worst result out of the second data set are shown. These are based on objective observations and not on quantitative measurements, as we do not have the ground truth to this data.
