\begin{abstract}
In this work we propose a fast and robust automatic femur segmentation from MRI data, in order to manufacture personal femoral implants. The automatic segmentation evolves around a Random Forest classifier, which has been designed from a data set that comprises 20 MRI volumes. Applying a 5-fold cross validation on this data set with the proposed segmentation yields a mean DICE of 0.91 with a standard deviation of 0.03. Additional methods to enhance the accuracy are discussed.
