== Preprocessing ==
- [x] Wiener filter
- [-] Median
- [-] Histogram Stretching/Normalization (all images should have similar histograms)


== Features == 
- [x] Standard deviation
- [x] Average
- [x] Entropy
- [ ] Skewness
- [ ] Position (X, Y, Z)
- [1] Relative/Normalized Position
- [3] Average (gaussian)
- [2] DoG

== Testing == 
- [ ] Script to test different set of features or parameters

== Plot ==
- [ ] Show predicted value on image

- [ ]
