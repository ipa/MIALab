== Preprocessing ==
- [x] Wiener filter
- [-] Median
- [-] Histogram Stretching/Normalization (all images should have similar histograms)
- [x] z-score normalization
- [-] histogram fitting normalization


== Features == 
- [x] Standard deviation
- [x] Average
- [x] Entropy
- [x] Skewness
- [x] Position (X, Y, Z)
- [x] Relative/Normalized Position
- [x] Average (gaussian)
- [x] LoG
- [-] Histogram bins (use matlab function ‘prctile’)

== Testing == 
- [ ] Script to test different set of features or parameters

== Plot ==
- [ ] Show predicted value on image
- [ ]
