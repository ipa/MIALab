The application needs the parallel toolbox active, since the prediction
runs slice per slice in a parallel for loop.

The following settings have to be changed in main.m before running the application
libPath: Path to the libraries we got from ILIAS (ReadData3d_version1k)
imageFile: The path to the .mhd file that has to be processed
showMRSlice: If this setting is set to true, an MR slice is projected into the volume rendering

Now the application can be run and no further user interaction is needed
